# UssdDemo
A demo project implemented to interact with ussd alert dialog programmatically in android.

This app will auto input "0" and click Send button in USSD Alert Dialog(s).

Please make one of your sim cards as default from the Sim Settings, so Call button on the app won't take you outside of the app to select sim cards!

Also enable Accessibility Permission beforehand for this app by going to Settings > Additional Settings > Accessibility; This path may be different in your phone.

Kill and restart the app if it doesn't work as expected even after enabling the Accessibility Permission.
